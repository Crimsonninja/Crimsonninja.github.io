I'm currently a senior studying a double major in Computer Science and Electrical Engineering at Santa Clara University! I've recently completed an internship at Apple on the Design Verification team within the Silicon Engineering Group where I had the opportunity to work on next-generation SOCs that end up in all Apple products.

## Some Intriguing Facts About Me

Besides programming, I love to perform close-up sleight-of-hand magic or as I like to call it, "prestidigitation." I'm a huge fan of both photography and videography, love playing Super Smash Bros (classic), and am a big playing card and vinyl collector.

## Why I Pursue Engineering

I have been visiting my father’s lab at Cisco Systems since I was six. An electrical engineer, my father constantly runs code to test circuit boards to ensure that all of the circuitry runs smoothly. I would stay up with him, watching for the word “pass” to light up onscreen whereupon he would high-five me, and we would go to bed. My first experience with software was equally memorable. I watched my brother type in a strange yet fascinating language. The words were in English but lacked any meaning to me at the time. Then, my brother ran his simulation. What manifested were colorful blocks endlessly raining down from a black oblivion: the game of Tetris.

I've decided to pursue a double major in electrical engineering and computer science, because both of these experiences have greatly impacted me. Both fields remind me that one always needs the other: that the programmer needs a person to build the computer upon which he or she programs, and that the hardware builder needs a coder to put his or her machinery to good use. By studying these two fields, I hope to obtain an even wider breadth of knowledge of the computer industry.
