I’m an Electrical Design Engineer at KLA, working on image computing systems. I’m most engaged by problems that live at the boundary between hardware and software, where abstractions eventually meet real-world constraints and small details matter.

## A Few Things I Enjoy

Outside of engineering, I gravitate toward hobbies that reward patience, craftsmanship, and repetition. I enjoy brewing coffee at home, collecting and wearing mechanical watches, and practicing close-up sleight-of-hand, or as I like to call it, prestidigitation. I’m also drawn to photography and videography as ways of slowing down and paying attention.

For balance, I spend a good amount of time on the court playing tennis and pickleball. Both offer equal parts competition, rhythm, and problem-solving in motion.

## Why Engineering Stuck

I’ve been around engineering for as long as I can remember. Growing up, I’d visit my father’s lab at Cisco Systems and watch him run tests on circuit boards late into the night. I didn’t understand the code, but I knew what it meant when the screen finally read “pass.” That moment, the quiet tension followed by certainty, stuck with me.

Around the same time, I watched my brother type lines of unfamiliar code and turn them into something tangible. A simple simulation became a cascade of falling blocks. It was my first glimpse into how invisible logic could produce visible, repeatable behavior.

Those early experiences shaped how I approach my work today. I’m still fascinated by the relationship between systems and outcomes, how software gives hardware purpose, and how hardware grounds software in reality.
