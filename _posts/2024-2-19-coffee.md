How a one-time coffee skeptic fell head-over-heels for espresso, from pandemic experiments at home to discovering the craft and comfort of the perfect cup.

As I sit here sipping on a perfectly brewed cup of coffee, I can't help but reflect on how far I've come in my relationship with this beloved beverage. Rewind a couple of years, and you would have found me scrunching up my face at the mere mention of coffee. Bitter, unappealing, and nothing more than a caffeine jolt to get through the day – that's how I saw it. Little did I know, my journey into the world of coffee was just beginning.

It all started during my internship at a company where my mentor, though not particularly passionate about coffee, introduced me to Philz Coffee. Philz was a game-changer for me – their unique blends are known for their sweeter profiles, which immediately appealed to my palate. Suddenly, coffee wasn't just a bitter brew but a flavorful experience waiting to be explored.

Then came the pandemic, and with it, a shift in perspective. My brother, a coffee enthusiast with a much more refined palate, decided to invest in an espresso machine – the Breville Barista Pro. He encouraged me to give it a try, starting with a simple latte to ease my taste buds into the world of coffee. Reluctantly, I agreed, and thus began my daily ritual of espresso-based drinks.

Over the next year, I slowly but surely developed a fondness for coffee. With each cup, I began to appreciate the nuances of flavor and the artistry behind brewing the perfect shot. At first, it was a simple distinction between sweet and bitter, but as I delved deeper into the world of coffee, my palate began to evolve.

I found myself drawn to the complexity of different roasts – from the bold intensity of a dark roast to the nuanced brightness of a light roast. Learning to discern these differences allowed me to explore a wide range of flavors, each cup offering a new sensory experience.

When my brother relocated to NYC in late 2021, I found myself missing our daily coffee rituals. Left to fend for myself, I turned to French Press pourovers and frequent visits to local coffee shops to satisfy my craving for quality brews. It wasn't long before I decided to take matters into my own hands and invest in a Breville Bambino, a sleek and compact espresso machine perfect for home use.

The Bambino quickly became my trusted companion, allowing me to experiment with different coffee recipes and techniques from the comfort of my own kitchen. But as my skills and appreciation for coffee continued to grow, I knew it was time for an upgrade. Enter the Lelit Mara – a powerhouse of a machine that elevated my home brewing experience to new heights.

Today, I consider myself a fully fledged home barista, passionate about exploring the world of specialty coffee and honing my craft with each pour. While I still enjoy the occasional visit to coffee shops for the ambiance and inspiration, there's something truly special about being able to brew the perfect cup of coffee in the comfort of my own home.

My journey into the world of coffee has been nothing short of transformative, proving that sometimes all it takes is a single cup to change your perspective – and your palate – forever. So here's to many more years of discovery, exploration, and of course, great coffee. Cheers!
