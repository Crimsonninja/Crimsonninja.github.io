What began as a graduation gift evolved into a lifelong fascination with mechanical timepieces—the design, the history, and the quiet satisfaction of wearing a story on the wrist.

If you scroll far enough back on this blog, you’ll find my very first post, an enthusiastic first impression of the Apple Watch Series 5. I was captivated by the Always-On Display, the seamless notifications, and the novelty of having technology strapped to my wrist. In many ways, that smartwatch marked the beginning of my fascination with timepieces. What I didn’t realize back then was that the Apple Watch would eventually lead me back to something older, quieter, and far more personal: mechanical watches.

My first real watch, the one that truly started it all, was the Carl F. Bucherer Manero Autodate. I bought it as a graduation gift to myself after finishing my master’s degree. It felt like a “big boy” watch, refined, elegant, and a signal that I was stepping into a new era of adulthood. Wearing it to the office, I loved the weight of it, the way the hands caught the light, and the understated confidence it projected. It suited my lifestyle perfectly at the time: structured, professional, and forward-looking.

Around that period, I fell back in love with tennis, a game I had left behind during school. Suddenly, my days were not limited to labs or meetings. They were spent running drills, chasing serves, and sweating through long matches. A dress watch, as beautiful as it was, simply did not belong on the court. I needed something that could keep up, something durable, sporty, and versatile.

That need led me to the Tudor Black Bay 58 Blue on a NATO strap. It felt freeing to wear a watch I did not have to baby. The crisp blue dial, the subtle vintage cues, and the comfort of the strap made it an easy companion both on and off the court. It was also my first experience with what many enthusiasts call a “daily driver,” a watch you reach for instinctively because it fits your life rather than demands attention.

I began to understand that watches are not just about function or fashion. They are reflections of where we are in life. The Rolex GMT-Master II ‘Coke’ reminds me of travel and exploration. The A. Lange & Söhne Saxonia Thin taught me restraint and showed me that elegance often lies in simplicity. The Cartier Tank Louis Small Yellow Gold showed me that art and engineering can coexist in something no larger than a matchbook.

I also started to notice the small rituals that made each piece special. The winding of a crown in the morning or the soft click of locking the clasp in. The way a simple strap change can alter the entire personality of a watch. These details slow you down, much like brewing a good cup of coffee, another ritual that has become central to my life.

Even today, I still appreciate the Apple Watch for what it does. It tracks my steps, my sleep, and my workouts. But while the Apple Watch measures time, mechanical watches make me feel it. They do not buzz or demand attention. They simply exist, quietly marking moments that often go unnoticed.

Over time, my collecting philosophy shifted. I stopped chasing specifications or hype and started focusing on meaning. Every piece I own represents a chapter, whether it marks a milestone, a mindset, or a memory. From the rugged charm of the Breitling Superocean to the warmth of the Universal Genève Uni-Compax, each watch connects me to something beyond the dial.

Watches, I have learned, are not just tools or trophies. They are mirrors. They remind us of who we were, who we are, and who we are becoming. And as I wind a watch before heading out the door, I am reminded that time is not just something to be kept. It is something to be cherished.

PS: If you are considering your first mechanical watch, price matters, and it should. Set a budget you are comfortable with and respect it. What you should not worry about is prestige. The right watch is the one that fits your life and feels right on your wrist, not the one that impresses someone else.
