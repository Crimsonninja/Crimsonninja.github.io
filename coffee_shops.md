I have a rather extensive list. There isn't necessarily a "best coffee shop" in my opinion. Different shops are good at different things, so keep that in mind as you read below!

## Best Cappuccino

**Devout Coffee**  
Location: Fremont, CA  
[Yelp](https://www.yelp.com/biz/devout-coffee-fremont)  
**Notes:**  
- The best cappuccino I’ve ever had from a shop
- Nice outdoor seating area
- Recommended drinks are any milk-based espresso drink and pourovers are great as well (roasts tend to be on the medium-dark side).  Espresso tonic is refreshing in the summertime.
- Also offer a selection of beans that are easy to dial in for home baristas (can expect nutty earthy flavors with more mouth texture and a full body since they are more roasted)
- Stay away from the cold brew though (but the Kyoto drippers are pretty cool to look at!)
- **Rating: 9/10**

## For the Vibes

**Sue’s Gallery Cafe**  
Location: Saratoga, CA  
[Yelp](https://www.yelp.com/biz/sues-gallery-cafe-saratoga-2)  
**Notes:**  
- If you want to relax and read a book, this is the place. Offer both indoor and outdoor seating. Also great place to take a friend (or two)
- All drinks I’ve had so far are very tasty and baristas are very good at latte art (Can recommend any espresso milk-based drink as well as their hojicha and charcoal latte)
- Have pottery/ceramics for sale (though they are quite expensive)
- Can work here as well, but it’s best to take an indoor seat if doing so. Indoor seating is more limited than outdoors.
- **Rating: 10/10**

**Living Room Coffee Craft**  
Location: Campbell, CA  
[Yelp](https://www.yelp.com/biz/living-room-coffee-craft-campbell)  
**Notes:**  
- Very cozy environment and is a great place to work (only thing is they close at 4 pm). Plenty of seating
- I’ve only had their cappuccino and their latte, and they’re pretty good!
- **Rating: 8/10**

## For the Beans

**Academic Coffee**  
Location: San Jose, CA (Downtown)  
[Yelp](https://www.yelp.com/biz/academic-coffee-san-jose-3)  
**Notes:**  
- Great tasting coffee so this is great if you want a nice cup and even better if you’re a home barista looking to pick up beans
- Selection is wide from dark roast to light roast. My preference is light roast, and with their beans, I’ve been able to pull fruity and floral shots without acidity.
- Espresso tonic is the best I’ve had (even better than Devout Coffee’s and I thought theirs was already good!)
- Nice outdoor space that is great in the summer (they only have a few seats indoors)
- **Rating: 8/10**

## Best for Working/Studies

**Big Mug Coffee**  
Location: Santa Clara, CA  
[Yelp](https://www.yelp.com/biz/big-mug-coffee-roaster-santa-clara)  
**Notes:**  
- Lots of Seats, but seating arrangement is not the most comfortable
- Open until 10 pm most days
- Wide selection of drinks
- Noisy, so if you’re working, I’d bring headphones
- **Rating: 7/10**

**Caffe Bene**  
Location: San Jose, CA  
[Yelp](https://www.yelp.com/biz/caffe-bene-san-jose)  
**Notes:**  
- Lots of seats and seating arrangement is comfortable
- Open late typically until 8 pm most days
- Drinks are decent (For a safe bet, I’d stick to their milk-based drinks (latte, cappuccino, etc.)). I usually get their shakerato or chai. Mint cold brew is also pretty good (although not as good as a Philz Mint Mojito)
- Not usually noisy, so headphones aren’t required for a focused work session
- **Rating: 7/10**

## Other Coffee Shops in the Bay

**Con Azucar Cafe** (Downtown SJ): Very instagrammable but that’s about it. Can expect drinks such as Horchata, Dulce de Leche, etc. **Rating: 4/10**  
**Voltaire Coffee** (Downtown SJ): They are also a roaster, but I’ve never tried their beans. Pretty good cappuccino. **Rating: 7/10**  
**Hannah Coffee** (San Jose, SJ on The Alameda): Limited seating. A pretty average coffee shop with standard cafe breakfast food options as well. **Rating: 5/10**  
**Coffee and Water Lab**: Extremely Scandi interior design. Can be a decent place to work, but not the most cozy. Have the latest and greatest equipment in coffee-making. Pretty good service and drinks are pretty good. **Rating: 7/10**  
**Blue Bottle** (Santa Clara, Palo Alto): Depending on the location you’re at, you can get some work done. I enjoy their Spiced Nola as well as their Nola Shakerato. If you see both on the menu, you can asked for a Spiced Nola Shakerato which is their best drink in my opinion. **Rating: 8/10**  
**Philz Coffee**: Best for sweet coffee. They brought me into the coffee game since I hated coffee before. Mint Mojito is bomb. **Rating: 10/10**  
**1 oz coffee** (Santa Clara, Mountain View): I prefer their Santa Clara location (since there’s more seating), but both make pretty good drinks. **Rating: 7/10**  
**Verve Coffee Roasters** (Palo Alto): I remember going here. Don’t remember the experience here very well. Guess it must have just been ok ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ May have to return to update this rating. With that said, their decaf bean is pretty solid for home baristas out there. **Rating: 6/10**  
**Roy’s Station** (Japantown SJ): Only been once. Had their Spiced Mocha which was pretty good. Have to return to evaluate their cappuccino. **Rating: 8/10**.   
**Red Rock Coffee** (Castro St., Mountain View): Average Coffee, made up for it by plenty of seating to work. They have an entire second floor for working as well. **Rating: 7/10**  
**Voyager Craft Coffee** (Santa Clara, Cupertino, San Jose): Don’t think I’ve had a bad coffee here. Interiors across stores are quite nice as well. Can make for a good work environment though I’ve never studied/worked here. Cappuccino is ok. I’d probably go with their specialty drinks like their Santiago or Bali for more interesting flavors. **Rating: 8/10**
