      <h1>Bay Area Coffee Shops</h1>
    </header>
    <!--  -->
    <p><p>I have a rather extensive list. There isn’t necessarily a “best coffee shop” in my opinion. Different shops are good at different things, so keep that in mind as you read below!</p>

<h2 id="best-cappuccino">Best Cappuccino</h2>

<p><strong>Devout Coffee</strong><br />
Location: Fremont, CA<br />
<a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/devout-coffee-fremont">Yelp</a><br />
<strong>Notes:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>The best cappuccino I’ve ever had from a shop</li>
  <li>Nice outdoor seating area</li>
  <li>Recommended drinks are any milk-based espresso drink and pourovers are great as well (roasts tend to be on the medium-dark side).  Espresso tonic is refreshing in the summertime.</li>
  <li>Also offer a selection of beans that are easy to dial in for home baristas (can expect nutty earthy flavors with more mouth texture and a full body since they are more roasted)</li>
  <li>Stay away from the cold brew though (but the Kyoto drippers are pretty cool to look at!)</li>
  <li><strong>Rating: 9/10</strong></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="for-the-vibes">For the Vibes</h2>

<p><strong>Sue’s Gallery Cafe</strong><br />
Location: Saratoga, CA<br />
<a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/sues-gallery-cafe-saratoga-2">Yelp</a><br />
<strong>Notes:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>If you want to relax and read a book, this is the place. Offer both indoor and outdoor seating. Also great place to take a friend (or two)</li>
  <li>All drinks I’ve had so far are very tasty and baristas are very good at latte art (Can recommend any espresso milk-based drink as well as their hojicha and charcoal latte)</li>
  <li>Have pottery/ceramics for sale (though they are quite expensive)</li>
  <li>Can work here as well, but it’s best to take an indoor seat if doing so. Indoor seating is more limited than outdoors.</li>
  <li><strong>Rating: 10/10</strong></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Living Room Coffee Craft</strong><br />
Location: Campbell, CA<br />
<a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/living-room-coffee-craft-campbell">Yelp</a><br />
<strong>Notes:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Very cozy environment and is a great place to work (only thing is they close at 4 pm). Plenty of seating</li>
  <li>I’ve only had their cappuccino and their latte, and they’re pretty good!</li>
  <li><strong>Rating: 8/10</strong></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="for-the-beans">For the Beans</h2>

<p><strong>Academic Coffee</strong><br />
Location: San Jose, CA (Downtown)<br />
<a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/academic-coffee-san-jose-3">Yelp</a><br />
<strong>Notes:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Great tasting coffee so this is great if you want a nice cup and even better if you’re a home barista looking to pick up beans</li>
  <li>Selection is wide from dark roast to light roast. My preference is light roast, and with their beans, I’ve been able to pull fruity and floral shots without acidity.</li>
  <li>Espresso tonic is the best I’ve had (even better than Devout Coffee’s and I thought theirs was already good!)</li>
  <li>Nice outdoor space that is great in the summer (they only have a few seats indoors)</li>
  <li><strong>Rating: 8/10</strong></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="best-for-workingstudies">Best for Working/Studies</h2>

<p><strong>Big Mug Coffee</strong><br />
Location: Santa Clara, CA<br />
<a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/big-mug-coffee-roaster-santa-clara">Yelp</a><br />
<strong>Notes:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Lots of Seats, but seating arrangement is not the most comfortable</li>
  <li>Open until 10 pm most days</li>
  <li>Wide selection of drinks</li>
  <li>Noisy, so if you’re working, I’d bring headphones</li>
  <li><strong>Rating: 7/10</strong></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Caffe Bene</strong><br />
Location: San Jose, CA<br />
<a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/caffe-bene-san-jose">Yelp</a><br />
<strong>Notes:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Lots of seats and seating arrangement is comfortable</li>
  <li>Open late typically until 8 pm most days</li>
  <li>Drinks are decent (For a safe bet, I’d stick to their milk-based drinks (latte, cappuccino, etc.)). I usually get their shakerato or chai. Mint cold brew is also pretty good (although not as good as a Philz Mint Mojito)</li>
  <li>Not usually noisy, so headphones aren’t required for a focused work session</li>
  <li><strong>Rating: 7/10</strong></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="other-coffee-shops-in-the-bay">Other Coffee Shops in the Bay</h2>

<p><strong>Con Azucar Cafe</strong> (Downtown SJ): Very instagrammable but that’s about it. Can expect drinks such as Horchata, Dulce de Leche, etc. <strong>Rating: 4/10</strong><br />
<strong>Voltaire Coffee</strong> (Downtown SJ): They are also a roaster, but I’ve never tried their beans. Pretty good cappuccino. <strong>Rating: 7/10</strong><br />
<strong>Hannah Coffee</strong> (San Jose, SJ on The Alameda): Limited seating. A pretty average coffee shop with standard cafe breakfast food options as well. <strong>Rating: 5/10</strong><br />
<strong>Coffee and Water Lab</strong>: Extremely Scandi interior design. Can be a decent place to work, but not the most cozy. Have the latest and greatest equipment in coffee-making. Pretty good service and drinks are pretty good. <strong>Rating: 7/10</strong><br />
<strong>Blue Bottle</strong> (Santa Clara, Palo Alto): Depending on the location you’re at, you can get some work done. I enjoy their Spiced Nola as well as their Nola Shakerato. If you see both on the menu, you can asked for a Spiced Nola Shakerato which is their best drink in my opinion. <strong>Rating: 8/10</strong><br />
<strong>Philz Coffee</strong>: Best for sweet coffee. They brought me into the coffee game since I hated coffee before. Mint Mojito is bomb. <strong>Rating: 10/10</strong><br />
<strong>1 oz coffee</strong> (Santa Clara, Mountain View): I prefer their Santa Clara location (since there’s more seating), but both make pretty good drinks. <strong>Rating: 7/10</strong><br />
<strong>Verve Coffee Roasters</strong> (Palo Alto): I remember going here. Don’t remember the experience here very well. Guess it must have just been ok ¯\<em>(ツ)</em>/¯ May have to return to update this rating. With that said, their decaf bean is pretty solid for home baristas out there. <strong>Rating: 6/10</strong><br />
<strong>Roy’s Station</strong> (Japantown SJ): Only been once. Had their Spiced Mocha which was pretty good. Have to return to evaluate their cappuccino. <strong>Rating: 8/10</strong>. <br />
<strong>Red Rock Coffee</strong> (Castro St., Mountain View): Average Coffee, made up for it by plenty of seating to work. They have an entire second floor for working as well. <strong>Rating: 7/10</strong><br />
<strong>Voyager Craft Coffee</strong> (Santa Clara, Cupertino, San Jose): Don’t think I’ve had a bad coffee here. Interiors across stores are quite nice as well. Can make for a good work environment though I’ve never studied/worked here. Cappuccino is ok. I’d probably go with their specialty drinks like their Santiago or Bali for more interesting flavors. <strong>Rating: 8/10</strong></p>
