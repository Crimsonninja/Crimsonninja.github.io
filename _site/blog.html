	    <h1>From Bitter to Bliss: My Journey into the World of Coffee</h1>
	  </header>
	  <span class="image main"><img src="/assets/images/mocha.jpg" alt="" /></span>
	  <p>02/19/2024</p>
	  <p><p>As I sit here sipping on a perfectly brewed cup of coffee, I can’t help but reflect on how far I’ve come in my relationship with this beloved beverage. Rewind a couple of years, and you would have found me scrunching up my face at the mere mention of coffee. Bitter, unappealing, and nothing more than a caffeine jolt to get through the day – that’s how I saw it. Little did I know, my journey into the world of coffee was just beginning.</p>

<p>It all started during my internship at a company where my mentor, though not particularly passionate about coffee, introduced me to Philz Coffee. Philz was a game-changer for me – their unique blends are known for their sweeter profiles, which immediately appealed to my palate. Suddenly, coffee wasn’t just a bitter brew but a flavorful experience waiting to be explored.</p>

<p>Then came the pandemic, and with it, a shift in perspective. My brother, a coffee enthusiast with a much more refined palate, decided to invest in an espresso machine – the Breville Barista Pro. He encouraged me to give it a try, starting with a simple latte to ease my taste buds into the world of coffee. Reluctantly, I agreed, and thus began my daily ritual of espresso-based drinks.</p>

<p>Over the next year, I slowly but surely developed a fondness for coffee. With each cup, I began to appreciate the nuances of flavor and the artistry behind brewing the perfect shot. At first, it was a simple distinction between sweet and bitter, but as I delved deeper into the world of coffee, my palate began to evolve.</p>

<p>I found myself drawn to the complexity of different roasts – from the bold intensity of a dark roast to the nuanced brightness of a light roast. Learning to discern these differences allowed me to explore a wide range of flavors, each cup offering a new sensory experience.</p>

<p>When my brother relocated to NYC in late 2021, I found myself missing our daily coffee rituals. Left to fend for myself, I turned to French Press pourovers and frequent visits to local coffee shops to satisfy my craving for quality brews. It wasn’t long before I decided to take matters into my own hands and invest in a Breville Bambino, a sleek and compact espresso machine perfect for home use.</p>

<p>The Bambino quickly became my trusted companion, allowing me to experiment with different coffee recipes and techniques from the comfort of my own kitchen. But as my skills and appreciation for coffee continued to grow, I knew it was time for an upgrade. Enter the Lelit Mara – a powerhouse of a machine that elevated my home brewing experience to new heights.</p>

<p>Today, I consider myself a fully fledged home barista, passionate about exploring the world of specialty coffee and honing my craft with each pour. While I still enjoy the occasional visit to coffee shops for the ambiance and inspiration, there’s something truly special about being able to brew the perfect cup of coffee in the comfort of my own home.</p>

<p>My journey into the world of coffee has been nothing short of transformative, proving that sometimes all it takes is a single cup to change your perspective – and your palate – forever. So here’s to many more years of discovery, exploration, and of course, great coffee. Cheers!</p>

<p>PS: If you’re ever in the Bay Area and looking to explore some of the best coffee spots around, check out my list of recommended cafes below. Whether you’re a seasoned coffee aficionado or simply seeking a cozy hideaway, these cafes promise an unforgettable experience. Until then, may your mornings be brightened by the delightful aroma of freshly brewed coffee. Enjoy your adventures and sip slowly!</p>

	    <h1>Apple Watch Series 5 First Impressions</h1>
	  </header>
	  <span class="image main"><img src="/assets/images/watch.jpg" alt="" /></span>
	  <p>09/22/2019</p>
	  <p><p>Before I begin, I’d like to mention that this is my first blog post, so I’m probably rough around the edges but…we’ll get there. Anyway, here we go. I’ve been an avid smartwatch fan for years. When I first interned at Eligo Energy, my boss happened to be an investor in a company called Pebble Technology Corporation that developed and popularized the first smartwatches (they initially launched on Kickstarter). At the end of my summer, he gifted me a Pebble Steel. It was the very first smartwatch I ever owned, and I was hooked! I no longer had “phantom pocket vibration syndrome” (knew exactly if and when notifications arrived on my phone) and could innocuously check them with a simple raise of a wrist. My high school teachers were totally oblivious.</p>

<p>Fast-forward four years and after many questions about whether the Pebble on my wrist was an Apple Watch, I made the switch to a Series 3. Activity tracking was great. But the real difference was that notifications were more integrated than ever before. I could respond to texts, answer calls, etc on the watch. At this point, Apple Watch was iconic. And with that, there definitely arose that awkward moment when I would be sitting in the front row and just out of curiosity of time, attempt to sneak a peak at the watch only to have the professor glaring at me as if I had just pulled out my phone.</p>

<p>Apple just launched their new Series 5 watch two days ago. Let me just say that the Always-On Display is amazing. With a quick glance, I can glean the time, temperature, etc. I can definitely see it come in handy in meetings and functions that don’t allow for blatantly raising your wrist to look at the time. But other than this, I don’t notice anything extra that the Series 5 does over the Series 3. Sure, there’s the new compass and ECG (which is also a Series 4 features), but I definitely haven’t used them and probably don’t see myself using them anytime soon.</p>

<p>Verdict: I’m loving my Series 5, but if you’ve got the Series 4, you definitely should stick with that. Unless, maybe you work in Sales and you <em>absolutely</em> have to sneak in a glance without your customer noticing. For any watch Series 3 and below, this new one is a nice upgrade!</p>
